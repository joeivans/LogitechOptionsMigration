The purpose of this repo is for me to migrate my mouse settings between work laptops. There are so many laptops and only one mouse that I use.

REQUIREMENTS:
        Windows 10, Logitech MX Anywhere 2S

WARNINGS:
        I can't guarantee this will work for you but it does work for me. Use at your own risk, obviously, like everything on the internet.

To use:
        You have to clone-in-place by initializing a new repo, tracking this remote, and then pulling the master into your new repo...

        1 - cd to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Logishrd\LogiOptions
        2 - git init .
        3 - git remote add origin https://github.com/joeivans/LogitechOptionsMigration.git
        4 - git pull origin master

        Replace [user] with your Windows user name.
